## Explain how CodeQL enables code scanning

**Describe CodeQL**  
https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/about-codeql/

**Define a QL pack, code query, code suite**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/creating-and-working-with-codeql-packs

https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/creating-codeql-query-suites

**Describe the default CodeQL query suites**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/creating-codeql-query-suites

**Describe how CodeQL analyzes code and produces results, including differences between compiled and interpreted language**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/analyzing-your-code-with-codeql-queries

## Use CodeQL for code scanning

**Introduce a CodeQL analysis workflow to a repository**

**List the locations in which CodeQL queries can be specified for use with code scanning**  
https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/providing-locations-in-codeql-queries/

**Configure the language matrix in a CodeQL workflow**  
https://github.com/advanced-security/set-codeql-language-matrix

**Reference a CodeQL query from a public repository within a code scanning workflow**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning

**Reference a CodeQL query from a private repository within a code scanning workflow**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning-at-scale

**Reference a CodeQL query from a local directory within a code scanning workflow**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-for-vs-code/getting-started-with-codeql-for-vs-code/running-codeql-queries

**Reference a configuration file within the same repository**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/specifying-command-options-in-a-codeql-configuration-file

**Reference a configuration file in a remote public repository**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/editing-your-configuration-of-default-setup

**Execute code scanning with the CodeQL command-line interface (CLI), including creating the CodeQL database, analyzing that database, and posting the SARIF results to GitHub**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli

**Contrast the steps to execute code scanning in GitHub Actions vs the CodeQL CLI**  
https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning

## Describe how to triage code scanning results from CodeQL analysis

**Describe how to view code scanning results from CodeQL analysis**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/viewing-code-scanning-logs

**Troubleshoot a failing code scanning workflow using CodeQL, including creating or changing a custom configuration in the CodeQL workflow**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-code-scanning

**Follow the data flow through code using the show paths experience**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-for-vs-code/getting-started-with-codeql-for-vs-code/exploring-data-flow-with-path-queries

**Explain the reason for a code scanning alert given documentation linked from the alert**  
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository

**Determine if and why a code scanning alert needs to be dismissed**
